## Understanding Spending Schedules

When creating a consumable waqf, you can choose how funds are distributed to beneficiaries. Each schedule type serves different needs and use cases.

---

## ‚ö° Immediate Distribution

### What It Is
Funds are distributed as quickly as possible to address urgent needs. This is the fastest way to get help to those who need it most.

### Best For
- Emergency relief situations
- Disaster response
- Time-sensitive medical needs
- Crisis intervention

### How It Works
1. You set a start and end date (e.g., 3 months)
2. Funds are distributed as fast as possible within that period
3. Goal is to help beneficiaries immediately

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Gaza Emergency Relief
```
Amount: $50,000
Timeline: 3 months
Distribution: As fast as possible
Goal: Provide food, medicine, and shelter to families
```

#### Example 2: Earthquake Response
```
Amount: $30,000
Timeline: Immediate (1 month)
Distribution: Emergency supplies and shelter
Goal: Help 500 families in first 30 days
```

#### Example 3: Medical Emergency Fund
```
Amount: $10,000
Timeline: 1 month
Distribution: Urgent surgeries and treatments
Goal: Save lives through immediate medical intervention
```

### Key Features
- ‚ùå Cannot extend timeline
- ‚è∞ Fixed end date
- üí∞ Can accept donations until end date
- üéØ Best for urgent, time-sensitive needs

## üìÖ Phased Distribution

### What It Is
Funds are distributed gradually at a steady monthly rate over a specified time period. Like a monthly salary for charity work.

### Best For
- Ongoing operational costs
- Salary support programs
- Regular meal distribution
- Long-term care programs

### How It Works
1. You set start and end dates (e.g., 24 months)
2. System calculates monthly distribution amount
3. Funds distributed each month at steady rate
4. **Bonus:** If you add more funds later, the end date automatically extends!

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Orphan Support Program
```
Amount: $24,000
Timeline: 24 months
Monthly Distribution: $1,000/month
Goal: Support 20 orphans with food, education, shelter

If you add $12,000 more:
- New end date: +12 months (36 months total)
- Monthly rate stays at $1,000/month
- Timeline extends automatically ‚ú®
```

#### Example 2: Community Food Program
```
Amount: $60,000
Timeline: 12 months
Monthly Distribution: $5,000/month
Goal: Feed 500 families monthly with food packages
```

#### Example 3: Teacher Salary Support
```
Amount: $36,000
Timeline: 36 months
Monthly Distribution: $1,000/month
Goal: Pay salaries for 2 teachers at Islamic school
```

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ Accepts additional donations anytime
- üìà Timeline extends proportionally with new donations
- üìä Predictable monthly distributions
- üîÑ Ideal for recurring expenses

### How Additional Funding Works
```
Original: $24,000 over 24 months = $1,000/month

You add: $6,000 (25% more)
Result: Timeline extends by 25% = 6 more months
New end date: 30 months total
Monthly rate: Still $1,000/month
```

## üéØ Milestone-Based Distribution

### What It Is
Funds are released only when specific achievements or goals are completed. Payment for verified progress.

### Best For
- Construction projects
- Multi-phase initiatives
- Project-based work
- Programs requiring verification

### How It Works
1. You define milestones with target amounts
2. Each milestone has a description and target date
3. Funds released only when milestone is completed
4. Admin verifies completion before releasing funds

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Water Well Construction
```
Total: $50,000 for rural village water well

Milestones:
1. ‚úì Foundation Complete (Month 1)
   ‚Üí Release $10,000

2. ‚è≥ Well Drilling Complete (Month 3)
   ‚Üí Release $20,000 when verified

3. ‚è≥ Pump & System Installed (Month 5)
   ‚Üí Release $15,000 when operational

4. ‚è≥ Testing & Community Training (Month 6)
   ‚Üí Release $5,000 final payment

Progress: 20% complete ($10,000 released)
```

#### Example 2: School Building Project
```
Total: $100,000 for primary school construction

Milestones:
- Design & Planning: $10,000
- Foundation: $25,000
- Structure & Walls: $35,000
- Roof & Windows: $20,000
- Interior & Furniture: $10,000

Each phase must be inspected before next payment
```

#### Example 3: Medical Camp Series
```
Total: $20,000 for 4 medical camps

Milestones:
- Camp Setup & Staff: $2,000
- First 100 Patients Treated: $6,000
- Second 500 Patients Treated: $8,000
- Final Camp & Reporting: $4,000

Payment based on verified patient records
```

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ Ensures accountability
- üîç Verification required before payment
- üìã Clear progress tracking
- üí™ Reduces risk of misuse

### Benefits
- Donors see exactly where money goes
- Funds released only for completed work
- Clear timeline with specific goals
- Can accept donations at any milestone

## ‚ôæÔ∏è Ongoing Distribution

### What It Is
Continuous distribution with no fixed end date. Funds are distributed monthly until a target is reached or you manually stop it.

### Best For
- Long-term community programs
- Indefinite support initiatives
- Programs that grow over time
- Open-ended charitable work

### How It Works
1. You set a minimum monthly distribution (e.g., $2,000/month)
2. Optionally set a target (amount or beneficiaries)
3. Distributes every month indefinitely
4. Stops when target reached OR funds depleted OR manually stopped
5. **Always accepts new donations!**

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Scholarship Fund
```
Initial Amount: $100,000
Monthly Distribution: $2,000/month
Target: 1,000 students helped

Timeline: ~50 months (4+ years) at current rate
But accepts donations anytime!

Someone adds $50,000:
- New timeline: ~75 months (6+ years)
- Same monthly rate: $2,000/month
- Target still: 1,000 students

Completes when: 1,000 students helped OR funds depleted
```

#### Example 2: Community Kitchen
```
Initial Amount: $50,000
Monthly Distribution: $1,000/month
Target: None (ongoing indefinitely)

Feeds 100 families per month
Accepts donations from community
Never ends - continues as long as funds available
```

#### Example 3: Healthcare Clinic Operations
```
Initial Amount: $200,000
Monthly Distribution: $5,000/month
Target: 10,000 patients treated

Covers:
- Doctor salaries

- Equipment maintenance

Community can contribute monthly to keep it running
```

### Key Features
- ‚ôæÔ∏è No end date required
- ‚úÖ Always accepts donations
- üéØ Optional targets (amount or beneficiaries)
