# Waqf Model Update - Islamic Endowment Structure

## Summary
Updated the codebase to properly reflect the Islamic Waqf endowment model where:
1. **Waqf Asset (Principal)** - The protected capital that establishes the waqf
2. **Donations** - Ongoing contributions that are added to the investment pool
3. **Investment Returns/Proceeds** - The ONLY funds distributed to charitable causes (principal is preserved)

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Definitions (`src/types/waqfs.ts`)
- **Renamed:** `initialCapital` ‚Üí `waqfAsset`
- **Updated documentation:** Clarified that waqfAsset is the principal endowment that is preserved and invested, with only proceeds distributed

### 2. Dashboard Display (`src/components/waqf/EnhancedWaqfDashboard.tsx`)
**Added new financial metrics display:**
- ‚úÖ **Waqf Asset** - Shows the protected principal endowment (amber/gold color)
- ‚úÖ **Total Donations** - Shows ongoing contributions that get invested (green)
- ‚úÖ **Investment Returns** - Shows total proceeds generated from investments (blue)
- ‚úÖ **Proceeds Distributed** - Shows investment returns distributed to causes (purple)

**Updated terminology:**
- "Current Balance" replaced with clearer separation between principal and returns
- Labels now emphasize that only "investment returns" go to causes
- Added descriptive text: "Protected endowment principal", "Ongoing contributions invested", "Total proceeds generated", "Investment returns to causes"

### 3. Waqf Form (`src/components/waqf/WaqfForm.tsx`)
**Updated form field:**
- Field name: `initialCapital` ‚Üí `waqfAsset`
- Label: "Initial Capital ($)" ‚Üí "Waqf Asset - Principal Amount ($)"
- Added placeholder: "Enter the principal endowment amount"
- Added helper text: "This principal amount will be preserved and invested. Only the investment returns will be distributed to your selected causes."
- Error message: "Initial capital must be greater than 0" ‚Üí "Waqf asset must be greater than 0"

### 4. Utilities (`src/lib/waqf-utils.ts`)
- Updated activity logging to reference `waqfAsset` instead of `initialCapital`

### 5. Admin Components (`src/components/admin/reportManager.tsx`)
- Updated mock waqf data to use `waqfAsset` instead of `initialCapital`

## Islamic Waqf Model Clarification

### Traditional Islamic Waqf Principles:
1. **Principal Preservation** - The original endowment (waqf asset) must be preserved
2. **Investment** - The principal is invested in Shariah-compliant instruments
3. **Distribution** - ONLY the investment returns/proceeds are distributed to beneficiaries
4. **Perpetuity** - The waqf continues indefinitely as long as the principal remains intact

### Implementation in the System:
```
Waqf Lifecycle:
1. Donor establishes waqf with minimum waqf asset (principal)
2. Donor can make ongoing donations that add to investment pool
3. Total capital (waqfAsset + donations) gets invested
4. Investment generates returns/proceeds
5. Returns are distributed to selected charitable causes
6. Principal remains protected for future generations
```

### Dashboard Metrics Explained:
- **Waqf Asset**: Starting principal that must be preserved
- **Total Donations**: Cumulative ongoing contributions beyond initial asset
- **Investment Returns**: Total proceeds generated from investing (waqfAsset + donations)
- **Proceeds Distributed**: Portion of investment returns given to causes
- **Current Balance**: Available returns ready for distribution (not yet distributed)

## Visual Design Updates
- Added 4-column grid layout (responsive to 2 columns on mobile)
- Each metric has distinct gradient colors and icons:
  - üèõÔ∏è Waqf Asset (Amber gradient) - represents the foundation/temple
  - üíµ Donations (Green gradient) - represents ongoing giving
  - üìà Investment Returns (Blue gradient) - represents growth
  - üéÅ Proceeds Distributed (Purple gradient) - represents impact

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. Add investment strategy selection (Shariah-compliant funds)
2. Show investment performance dashboard
3. Add distribution scheduling/automation
4. Implement waqf asset growth tracking over time
5. Add beneficiary impact reports showing how proceeds helped causes

## Testing Recommendations
1. Create new waqf and verify waqfAsset is saved correctly
2. Update existing waqf and ensure waqfAsset displays properly
3. Check that all financial calculations use correct field names
4. Verify dashboard shows all 4 metrics correctly
5. Test form validation for waqfAsset field
